# Blockchain-based File Verifier

This is a blockchain-based file verification project built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org).

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a custom font designed for Vercel projects.

## About the Project

This blockchain-based file verifier allows users to:
- Upload files and store their hash on the blockchain
- Verify the integrity of files by comparing their hash with the one stored on the blockchain
- Track the history and provenance of files
